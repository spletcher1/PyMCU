Need to create a Python environment to install relevant pacakges because they are not all available as part of the distro.
See https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-python-modules-raspberry-pi

In the virtual environment, install required python packages: cobs, matplotlib, pyudev, smbus2, pyserial,adafruit-blinka,
        adafruit-circuitpython-tsl2591,adafruit-circuitpython-si7021

Note that GPIO is not available on the PI5.  Need to change to allow modifications on the pins.
